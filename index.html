                <h2>A Flyby Survey</h2>
                <p>With a fondness for learning of all kinds, I enjoy every discovery, every insight that I gleam from the grit of knowledge acquisition.  I enjoy the process as well as the fruit of the labor.  Every website that I build gives me wonder over the capability of code to produce desired appearances, every web application I build makes me excited over being able to allow for dynamic changes of website architecture, and every discovery about how servers function gives me the satisfaction of learning how the web functions piece by piece.</p>

                <h2>How I Learned</h2>
                <p>Learning the art and craft of Web Development has been an incredible journey full of surprises and excitement.  After tutorial after tutorial and project after project, I know I have the confidence to learn and adapt to many standards and technologies and respond to the needs of the customer and the company for which I work.</p>

                <h2>My Work</h2>
                <p>In learning Web Development, I have focused on the areas that will allow me to see the biggest picture possible and hone in onto details that bring varieties of projects to life.  I have worked on projects involving Express.js, Node.js, ES6, DOM Manipulation, Functional JavaScript, Loops, HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.  I have the knowledge to take Front-End projects to completion and the desire to learn more and more to do the same on the Back End.</p>
